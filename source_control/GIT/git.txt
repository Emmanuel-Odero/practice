		FIRST SETTING UP GIT TO CONNECT WITH GITHUB
=>To check if git is already installed we type "git version"
=>Next step is to configure your git credentials. This should be the first step
	->git config --global user.name 'name'
	->git config --global user.email 'email'
	->git config --global --list         #this list all the settings on git

	FIRST STEP TO TRACKING A FILE IN YOUR LOCAL MACHINE
=>Now it's time to initiate git on a directory we would like to work on 
	-> git init
=>Now check the status of your files for those that have not been updated and even chaneges made
	->git status
=>Add the changes to the staging area.
	->git add ./git add -A #add all the changes to the staging area this can take specific file also
	NB: To remove from the staging area we do "git reset <file or all>"
=>To add all changes and commit changes
	->git add . #this will first add the changes to the staging area
	->git commit -m 'just a new change'
=>After These commits have been added we now create a file online and name it for example practice.
Add the URL copied, which is your remote repository to where your local content from your repository is pushed.
	->git remote add origin 'your_url_name' NB:Original is the remote name

=>We can download projects from remote computers and clone them to our local computer and this 
  can be done through either SSH or HTTP. Note that this cloned will inherit all the git features from 
  the original git.
	->git clone <link of the project you would like to clone>
=>we can switch branches in git and this is how if in another branch we would branch to the master
	->git checkout /<name-of-branch>
=>Add a remote repository
	->git remote add <source-name (remote name)> <repository-path>
=>To create a branch
	->git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
=>To view the branches 
	->git branch

=>Delete a branch locally
	->git branch -d localbranchname
=>Delete a branch remotely
	->git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
=>To merge a branch with master branch
	->git checkout <name-of-branch>
	->git merge master
